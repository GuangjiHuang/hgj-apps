Paste an image from the local clipboard into this session.

Instructions:
1. Run `ccimg` using the Bash tool. It connects to the local ccimgd daemon via TCP on 127.0.0.1:9998 (available through SSH reverse tunnel), receives the clipboard image, saves it as a temporary PNG file, and prints the file path.
2. Use the Read tool to read the printed file path. This will display the image to Claude.
3. The user can then describe what they need help with.

```bash
ccimg
```
